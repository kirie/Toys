// Insertion sort is a basic sorting algorithm.

// Insertion sort iterates over an array, growing a sorted array behind the current location.
// It takes each element from the input and finds the spot, up to the current point, where that
// element belongs (in constant space). It does this until it gets to the end of the array.

// Insertion sort should be implemented as a stable sort. This means that equal elements
// should retain their relative order. Numbers, as primitives, give us no way to check this,
// so weâ€™ll be sorting objects with a value field, on which they will be sorted, like so:

// [{value: 10}, {value: 5, order: 1}, {value: 5, order: 2}]

// A stable sort must return {value: 5, order: 1}, {value:5, order: 2} in that order.
